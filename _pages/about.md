I received the B.Eng. degree from the South China University of Technology in 2013, the M.Eng. degree from the Sun Yat-sen University in 2016, and the Ph.D. degree from The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong in 2021. In 2014 and 2017, I was a visiting research student at City University of Hong Kong and Aalborg University, respectively. From 2022-2023, I was a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering, the Hong Kong Polytechnic University. Currently, I am a Research Assistant Professor in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, the University of Hong Kong. 

I was the recipient of the IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics (TPEL) Prize Paper Award (First Place) in 2023, the IEEE Power Electronics Society Ph.D. Thesis Talk Award in 2022, the University of Hong Kong Power Engineering Prize in 2020, and China National Scholarship in 2016. So far, I have published 41 peer-review articles, including 12 top-tier journals publications and 17 conference publications as the first author. My research interests include power electronics and wireless power transfer.
